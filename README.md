# Metaviators Network Server

Test setup with AWS backend - linux server running!

Notes:
Download and open the project in Unity 2019.4.34f1 LTS. Use 'ParrelSync' to clone the project (unity top menu).
Open the clone in a second editor -- play the project in BOTH editors. Delete 'localhost' entry in each editor and replace 
with the IP address sent to your email. Hit 'client' in both editors and use the keyboard arrows to move the cubes, via the serer.
